# The handshake must be the FIRST thing sent.

# Using { printf...; cat; } | socat ... works for sending TO the socket.
# But socat also sends FROM the socket to stdout.
# The `cat` reads from this script's stdin (which is the client's data).

# NOTE: We use `socat` with `STDIO` to connect this script's stdin/stdout to the socket.
# But we need to inject the handshake.
